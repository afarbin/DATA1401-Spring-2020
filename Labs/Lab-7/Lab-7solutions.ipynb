In lecture we also created a `grade_summer` calcuator that takes a prefix (for example `e1_` and a number `n`) and sums all grades starting with that prefix up to `n` and creates a new sum grade. Update this calculator (below) to the new design of our algorithm classes. Test your updated calculator by using it to sum the grades for all labs, quizzes, and exams of each student."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hlk1CBk0HjT4","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Note this is the OLD design... you will need to modify it.\n","\n","class summary_calculator(alg):   \n","    def __init__(self,name):\n","        alg.__init__(self,name)\n","\n","    def apply(self,a_student):\n","        raise NotImplementedError\n","\n","class grade_summer(summary_calculator):\n","    def __init__(self,prefix,n):\n","        self.__prefix=prefix\n","        self.__n=n\n","        summary_calculator.__init__(self,\"Sum Grades\")\n","        \n","    def apply(self,a_student):\n","        labels=[self.__prefix+str(x) for x in range(1,self.__n)]\n","        \n","        grade_sum=0.\n","        for label in labels:\n","            grade_sum+=a_student[label].value()\n","\n","        a_student.add_grade(grade(self.__prefix+\"sum\",value=grade_sum))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Kcfhwj7EHjT8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Curving Grades\n","\n","*Exercise 4:* Use the `mean_std_calculator` above to calculate the mean and standard deviation for every lab, quiz, and exam in the class.
