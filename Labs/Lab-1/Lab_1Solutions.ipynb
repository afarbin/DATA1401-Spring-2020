        "\n",
        "   - You can see the contents contents a file using the \"cat\" (concatenate) command. Try executing \"cat /etc/passwd\". You'll get a huge list that will go by your screen quickly. \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - To go through the file page by page, you can use the \"less\" or \"more\" commands. \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - You can see the first or last N (N=10 by default) lines of a file using \"head\" or \"tail\" commands. For example \"tail -20 /etc/passwd\" will list the last 20 lines. \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - You can search a test file using the \"grep\" command, which takes a string keyword as the first argument and a filename as the second, and by default prints out every line in the file that contrains the string. So for example you can do \"grep \\$USER /etc/passwd\" to find the line corresponding to your account. Some useful flags: \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - \"-i\" ignores the case of the keyword\n",
        "   - \"-v\" display those lines that do NOT match \n",

        "   - \"-c\" print only the total count of matched lines \n",
        "   \n",
        "   For example \"grep -c \\$USER /etc/passwd\" should show that you are in the password file just once. \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - The \"wc\" (word count) command counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. By default \"wc\" gives you all three numbers, but \"-w\", \"-l\", or \"-c\" flags \n",
