The program is called \"ssh\" (secure shell). You can \"ssh\" to another machine from your machine, by simply typing \"ssh\" followed by the machine name or IP address.

You'll get a slash (\"/\") separated list, known as the path, of the directory hierarchy of your current working directory. On Colab, this will start with \"contents\"\n","\n","Now back to thinking about the command prompt. Since \"ls\" is a program, it most be stored somewhere. It is clearly not in your working directory, because you didn't see it when you executed \"ls\". We can ask the shell to tell us where it found \"ls\" using the \"which ls\" command. Note that \"which\" is also a program. \"which ls\" comes back with \"/bin/ls\", telling you the \"ls\" program is sitting in \"/bin\" directory of the system. \n","\n","Lets see what else is in there by issuing a \"ls /bin\" command.

You may be able to guess what some of these programs do, but if you want to know, most of them provide you help, using \"--help\" or \"-h\" flag. For example execute \"ls --help\". For more information about a program or command, you can use Unix's manual pages using the \"man\" command. Try typing \"man ls\". Note that you will need to press space to scroll through lengthy manual pages and \"q\" to exit back to the shell prompt. \n","\n","Another command interesting is \"echo\". \"echo\" simply prints whatever you put after it to the screen. Try executing \"echo Hello World.\"\n","\n","At this point, you may wonder how was it that the shell knew to look for programs in \"/bin\"? The shell keeps a list of places to look for programs an environment variable with the name \"PATH\". The shell keeps a table that map string variable names to string expressions. When the shell starts, its configuration files set some environment variables that it uses. You can see the full list of defined environment variables using the command \"printenv\".\n","\n","You can use a environment variable in a shell by prepending name of the variable with a dollar sign character (\"\\$\"). So you can print out the PATH environment variable using the command \"echo $PATH\".
