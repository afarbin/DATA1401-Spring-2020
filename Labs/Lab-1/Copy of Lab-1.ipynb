It is clearly not in your working directory, because you didn't see it when you executed \"ls\". We can ask the shell to tell us where it found \"ls\" using the \"which ls\" command.

Let get some familiarity with the most commonly used commands to manipulate files.\n","\n","   - You can see the contents contents a file using the \"cat\" (concatenate) command. Try executing \"cat /etc/passwd\". You'll get a huge list that will go by your screen quickly. \n","   \n","   - To go through the file page by page, you can use the \"less\" or \"more\" commands. \n","   \n","   - You can see the first or last N (N=10 by default) lines of a file using \"head\" or \"tail\" commands. For example \"tail -20 /etc/passwd\" will list the last 20 lines. \n","   \n","   - You can search a test file using the \"grep\" command, which takes a string keyword as the first argument and a filename as the second, and by default prints out every line in the file that contrains the string. So for example you can do \"grep \\$USER /etc/passwd\" to find the line corresponding to your account. Some useful flags: \n","   \n","   - \"-i\" ignores the case of the keyword\n","   - \"-v\" display those lines that do NOT match \n","   - \"-n\" precede each matching line with the line number \n","   - \"-c\" print only the total count of matched lines \n","   \n","   For example \"grep -c \\$USER /etc/passwd\" should show that you are in the password file just once. \n","   \n","   - The \"wc\" (word count) command counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. By default \"wc\" gives you all three numbers, but \"-w\", \"-l\", or \"-c\" flags \n","\n","*Exercise 4:* Count how many lines in the password file contain the letter \"w\".

Other pipes are \"stdin\" (standard input) and \"stderr\" (standard error), where error messages are written.\n","\n","As discussed in lecture, the basic commands of are simple, but you can chain them to do complicated things. Redirection is how you chain these commands, directing the output of one command to the input of the next.\n","\n","As an example, consider the \"cat\" command. Cat takes stdin and outputs it to stdout. Type \"cat\" and press enter and confirm. You can get back to the command prompt by pressing \"control-c\" (sends terminate singal) or \"control-d\" (end of file character). Note that from now on we will use the convention: \"control-d\" = \"^D\"\n","\n","*Exercise 5a:* Using \"cat\" and indirection you can write things into a file.
